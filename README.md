### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt prepared to complete the assignment. Personally, it helped that I have previous web-dev experience, so I was able to get started on some of the more complicated features earlier.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I think I probably would've tried to add some sort of search filtering feature (for things like languages, release date, etc.). I did try to implement this, but the search API was fairly limited, so it would have required manually filtering results (which I didn't have time to implement effectively).

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went pretty well :smiley:
